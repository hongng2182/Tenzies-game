# Tenzies Game
A small dice game I created when learning React, based on this [Bob Giroll React tutorial](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=38657), but I added some additional features.

## Game idea
Roll 10 dice until they're all the same. Each time you can click on any die to hold it, and when "Roll" is clicked, the hold dice wont't change. Play until all dice are the same number, then you'll win. You can track how long it takes you to win the game and how many rolls you've had.

## Added Features

* Put real dots on the dice instead of just numbers like the tutorial
* Track the number of rolls in each round
* Track the time it took to win the game
* Save the best time to win the game to localStorage and show its statistics on a little badge at the corner left of the interface.
